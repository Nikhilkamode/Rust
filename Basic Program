What is a macro?

A macro is an expression that has
an exclamation mark (!) before the parenthesis () , i.e.,

                                 macro_name ! ( );

What are macros used for?

They are used in metaprogramming, i.e., code that writes code. They look like functions in other system programming languages like C and C++, but instead of generating a function call like functions, they are expanded into source code that gets compiled with the rest of the program. In this way, they provide more run-time features.

Types of Macros

Rust provides us with some built-in macros, like the println!() above, and users can define their own macros as well.
