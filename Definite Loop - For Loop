What Is a for Loop?
A for loop is a definite loop, meaning, the number of iterations is defined.

Example#
The following example uses a for loop that prints 5 numbers.

fn main() {
    //define a for loop 
    for i in 0..5 {
      println!("{}", i);
    }
}

Output
0
1
2
3
4

Explanation
for loop definition

On line 3 a for loop is defined.
Variable i is an iterator variable that iterates over the range with the lower bound as 0 and the upper bound as 5. From here the body of the loop starts.
for loop body

The body of the for loop is defined from line 3 to line 5

In each iteration:

On line 4, the value of the variable i is printed.
The value of the variable i is incremented by 1.
The iterator variable i traverses over the range until the upper bound is reached.

Note: The lower bound is inclusive and the upper bound is exclusive in the range

Enumerate
To count how many times the loop has already executed, use the .enumerate() function.

Example
The example below prints the frequency of iterations and the value of variable.
fn main() {
  for (count, variable) in (7..10).enumerate() {
      println!("count = {}, variable = {}", count, variable);
  }
}

Output
0.8s
count = 0, variable = 7
count = 1, variable = 8
count = 2, variable = 9

Explanation
enumerated for loop definition

On line 2 an enumerate for loop is defined.
The variable variable iterates over the range with the lower bound as 7 and the upper bound as 10 and a variable count which shows how many times the loop is iterated. From here the body of the loop starts.

On line 3, the value of count and variable is printed and then incremented by 1.
