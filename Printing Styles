fn main() {
    println!("Rust Programming");
    println!("Course");

eprint!()
The eprint!() macro displays the output as an error.

Example
The following example prints “Rust Programming” and “Course” on the same line but as an error.
fn main() {
    eprint!("Rust Programming");
    eprint!(" Course");
}
