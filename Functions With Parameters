//function definition
fn my_func(param_1:i32, param_2:i32) {
  println!("The first value passed inside function : {}", param_1);
  println!("The second value passed inside function : {}", param_2);
}
fn main() {
  let value_1 = 1;
  let value_2 = 2;
  //calling the function
  my_func( value_1, value_2 );

}

Output

The first value passed inside function : 1
The second value passed inside function : 2
Function ended

Explanation
The above program comprises two functions, the user defined function my_func() and the driver function main() where the function is being called.

User defined function
The function my_func() is defined from line 2 to line 5.

Two parameters param_1 and param_2 are passed to the function.
The values of passed parameters are printed on line 3 and line 4.
Driver function
The driver function main() is defined from line 6 to line 12.

On line 7 and line 8, two variables value_1 and value_2 are defined.
On line 10, the function is invoked while passing the value of the variable value_1 as the first argument and that of value_2 as the second.

Types of Arguments
Arguments can be passed to a function in two different ways:

Pass by value
Pass by reference
