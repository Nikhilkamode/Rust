What Is a Nested Loop?
A nested loop is a loop within a loop.

fn main() {
 for i in 1..5{ //outer loop
  println!("Multiplication Table of : {}", i);
   for j in 1..5 { // inner loop
       println!("{} * {} = {}", i, j, i * j);
   }
 }
}

Output
Multiplication Table of : 1
1 * 1 = 1
1 * 2 = 2
1 * 3 = 3
1 * 4 = 4
Multiplication Table of : 2
2 * 1 = 2
2 * 2 = 4
2 * 3 = 6
2 * 4 = 8
Multiplication Table of : 3
3 * 1 = 3
3 * 2 = 6
3 * 3 = 9
3 * 4 = 12
Multiplication Table of : 4
4 * 1 = 4
4 * 2 = 8
4 * 3 = 12
4 * 4 = 16

Explanation
Outer for Loop

A for loop is defined on line 2
The loop takes i as an iterator that iterates over values from 1 to 5.
Inner for Loop

A for loop is defined on line 4
The loop takes j as an iterator that iterates over values from 1 to 5.
For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs four times while printing the product of variables i and j.
